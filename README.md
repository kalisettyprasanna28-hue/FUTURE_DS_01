  - Total Sales = SUM(Sales)
  - Total Profit = SUM(Profit)
  - Profit Margin = [Total Profit] / [Total Sales]
  - Sales Growth % = (CurrentYearSales - PreviousYearSales) / PreviousYearSales
- Developed KPIs for quick performance monitoring.  

### 4️⃣ Visualization & Storytelling
- Designed multiple dashboard pages using *Power BI visuals*:
  - Sales Overview  
  - Profit by Category  
  - Customer Insights  
  - Regional Map  
- Added filters, slicers, and interactive visuals for better exploration.
